Fitness Tracker

INTRO:
This application was created for the purpose of creating and tracking your fitness routine!
The motivation behind this project was to build a CRUD application that would track my workouts.

This was my one of my first few projects utilizing the ReactJS librarym so there was a little bit of a learning curve involved with understanding components, hooks, and props! After creating this project I walked away with a greater understanding of React and why it is such a powerful framework for creating fast, scalable, and simple user interfaces for web applications.
